## Basic considration to host a large language model on Kubernetes
We tried to create the GPU cluster managed by AWS EKS and other AWS services to host the large language model, in consideration of its request performance, resource scaling speed, load balance efficiency, API integration with external system and operation simplicity e.g. upgrade the model hosted periodically.

1. AWS EKS Cluster Setup
- EKS Cluster: Create an EKS cluster in a region that supports the desired GPU instance types (e.g., p3, p4, g4dn instances).
Node Groups: Set up managed node groups with GPU instances. Use Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to enable automatic scaling based on demand.
- Cluster Autoscaler: Implement the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to adjust the number of nodes in the cluster as needed.
- GPU Drivers: Ensure that the Kubernetes nodes are equipped with the necessary GPU drivers and CUDA toolkit for optimal performance.

2. Load Balancing and Networking
- Load Balancer: Use an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming API requests across the pods running your language model.
- Ingress Controller: Deploy an Ingress controller in your EKS cluster that integrates with the ALB for fine-grained traffic management.
- Amazon Route 53: Use Route 53 for DNS management and to route user requests to the ALB efficiently.

3. Resource Management and Scaling
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Implement HPA to scale the number of pods in a deployment or replica set based on observed CPU and memory usage.
- Amazon CloudWatch: Utilize CloudWatch to monitor resource utilization and trigger scaling actions.
- Elastic Resource Allocation: Consider using Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for workloads that require high levels of inter-node communication.

4. API Integration
- Amazon API Gateway: Expose the language model's API through API Gateway for secure access, throttling, and integration with external systems.
- AWS Lambda: Use Lambda functions to handle pre-processing or post-processing of requests or to trigger asynchronous workflows.

5. Data Storage and Caching
- Amazon EFS: Use Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) for persistent storage that can be shared across multiple nodes.
- Amazon ElastiCache: Implement ElastiCache (Redis or Memcached) to cache frequent queries and reduce latency.

6. Security
- IAM Roles: Assign IAM roles to EKS and other services with the principle of least privilege.
- Security Groups: Configure security groups to control the traffic to the EKS cluster and other resources.
- Kubernetes Network Policies: Apply network policies at the Kubernetes level for pod-to-pod communication.
