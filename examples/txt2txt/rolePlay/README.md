## Background
Role play application using open sourced framework *silly tavern* and *character editor*

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
```
for Release Branch: git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern -b release
for Staging Branch: git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern -b staging
```

2. cd SillyTavern to run the start.sh script with one of these commands:
```
./start.sh
bash start.sh
```
 
3. The web application will be available at http://localhost:8000, and set the API key and select the built-in character card to start the conversation. The terminal will display the server log each time you interact with the web application.

4. Using the [character editor](https://github.com/ZoltanAI/character-editor), you can create your own character card and save it to the Silly Tavern server. You can use the sample character card (Albert Einstein) and upload it to the Silly Tavern server to see how workflow works.
