## Background
To use AWS Bedrock (Claude 3) to identify the content of an image with a flow inside a diagram, extract the detailed object workflow, and transform it into Mermaid chart code, you need to follow several steps. This involves leveraging the multi-modal capabilities of Claude 3, setting up the proper prompt template, and invoking the model API. Below is a detailed guide with sample code.

## Core Components
- Multi-modal Capability API Invocation: This involves invoking the AWS Bedrock model with a multimodal prompt that includes the image data.
- Proper Prompt Template: Crafting an appropriate prompt to guide the model in identifying and extracting the necessary information from the image.
- Transformation to Mermaid Chart Code: Converting the extracted workflow details into Mermaid chart code.
