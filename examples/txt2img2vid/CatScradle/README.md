## Cat's cradle
Cat's cradle (翻花绳) is a string game that can be played by one or more people with a loop of string. The name of the entire game, the specific figures, their order, and the names of the figures vary. The game consists of two or more players making a sequence of string figures, each altering the figure made by the previous player. The game has many variations, and it may go by different names depending on location, but the object of the game is to get to the final figure before the other player does. The game is over when a player makes a mistake or a player creates a figure that cannot be created. Now we try to use in laptop camera and basic image processing to visualize the hand movement, the string figure and the shadow between the hand and the string figure with stylized effect, such idea was inpired by the tourial of graduation exhibition of the students from the CAFA (Central Academy of Fine Arts) in 2024.
